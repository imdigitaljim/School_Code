                The Ferrari California is a grand touring sports car produced by the Italian manufacturer
                Ferrari. It is a two door "2+2" hard top convertible. The California is powered
                by front-mid mounted gasoline direct injection 4.3 L (260 cu in) V8 with 460 PS
                (338 kW; 454 hp), The car revives the "California" name used for the late-1950s
                Ferrari 250 GT.The California was launched at the 2008 Paris Motor Show. According
                to industry rumors, the California originally started as a concept for a new Maserati,
                but the resulting expense to produce the car led the Fiat Group to badge it as a
                Ferrari in order to justify the high cost of purchase; the company denies this,
                however. The California represents a new, fourth model range for the company.The
                California is built in a new production line adjacent to the existing factory at
                Maranello. The existing production line produces 27 cars per day, or 6,000 per year.</p>
