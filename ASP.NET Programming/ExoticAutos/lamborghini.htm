            <p>
                LP 700–4 is a two-door, two-seater sports car publicly unveiled by Lamborghini at
                the Geneva Motor Show on 28 February 2011, five months after its initial unveiling
                in Sant'Agata Bolognese. Internally codenamed LB834, the Aventador was designed
                to replace the ten-year-old Murciélago as the new flagship model in the Lamborghini
                lineup starting in 2011. Soon after the Aventador unveiling, Lamborghini announced
                that it had already sold over 12 months of the production vehicles, with deliveries
                starting in the second half of 2011.</p>
            <h2>
                Lamborghini Gallardo</h2>

            <p>
                The first generation Gallardo came with a 5 liter 90 degree V10 (4961cc), based
                on Audi's 4.2 Liter V8 developed by Cosworth. The Gallardo offers two choices of
                transmissions, a conventional (H-Box) six-speed manual transmission, and an advanced
                six-speed electro-hydraulically controlled semi-automatic robotized manual, which
                Lamborghini abbreviates to "E-gear". The "E-gear" allows the driver to make shifts
                much faster than they could with a manual transmission. The driver shifts up and
                down via paddles behind the steering wheel, but can also change to an automatic
                mode For the MY2006 (launched in late 2005) Lamborghini introduced many changes
                to the car to counter some criticisms garnered from the press and owners. These
                were based on the limited edition Gallardo SE. The exhaust system was changed to
                a more sporty one (including a flap to make it quieter around town), the suspension
                was revised, a new steering rack was fitted, the engine power was increased by 20
                bhp to a maximum of 520 metric horsepower (382 kW; 513 hp), and the biggest change
                was an overall lowering of the gearing, especially in 1st to 5th. The result was
                a much improved car; it handled and turned better, sounded better under full throttle
                and the extra power and lower gearing made an already fast car into a much faster
                one.
