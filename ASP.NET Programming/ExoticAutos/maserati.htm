                (Italian for "four-door"), a sporting-luxury four-door saloon. Introduced in 2004
                and facelifted in 2009. Quattroporte S, featuring the same 4.7L V8 as the Maserati
                GranTurismo S was introduced also in 2009. Maserati started production of the Pininfarina-designed
                Quattroporte, with the same dry sump 4.2 L engine as the Coupé, Spyder and the new
                GranTurismo but improved to 400 PS (294 kW). Due to its greater weight than the
                Coupé and Spyder, the 0-62 mph (0–100 km/h) time for the Quattroporte is 5.6 seconds
                and the top speed is 167 mph (269 km/h).[11] The Quattroporte was unveiled to the
                world at the Frankfurt Motor Show on September 9, 2003 and made its US première
                at the 2003 Pebble Beach Concours d'Élégance. It is a continuation of the long tradition
                of Quattroporte luxury saloons in the Maserati line-up.</p>

                The first presentation of this car on 20 of April 2013 in Shanghai. It is a saloon,
                smaller than the Quattroporte (press have called it the 'baby Quattroporte'[citation
                needed]), that will compete against the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes E-Class or Audi A6
                and will be based on a Chrysler platform.[citation needed] This new model is expected
                to be key in order to reach the ambitious target sales of 50000 cars a year by 2015.
                The official presentation is expected in the upcoming Shanghai Motor Show. The car,
                along with the new Quattroporte, will be built in the Italian factory of Grugliasco,
                in Piedmont (former Bertone).</p>

                A 4.2-litre V8 grand tourer introduced in 2007 has 405 PS (298 kW; 399 hp) in standard
                from and year later introduced GranTurismo S version has 4.7-litre and 440 PS (324
                kW; 434 hp). Replacing both the GranTurismo S and S Automatica, the Granturismo
                Sport was unveiled in March 2012 at the Geneva Motor Show. The revised 4.7L engine
                is rated 460 PS (338 kW; 454 hp). The Sport features a unique, MC Stradale inspired
                front fascia, new headlights and new, sportier steering wheel and seats. The ZF
                six-speed automatic gearbox is now standard, while the six-speed sequential transaxle
                is available as an option. The latter has steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters,
                a feature that’s optional with the automatic gearbox.</p>
