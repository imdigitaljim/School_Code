Assignment 2

Machine: Linprog

External dependencies:
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <chrono>
#include <cstring>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>


The code can be compiled using 'make'

make clean - remove all executables and object code

The program can be run using the assignment required:
'algorithm <sortname> <filename>'

Additionally, the program will run using 'algorithm'
which can allow randomization of data and timing for test cases.
The printing has been commented out for console reading, however,
if you want to output to a file:
uncomment the print lines, edit the 'in' file for the desired
configuration, and you can redirect the output and check for array
correctness of the test cases
'algorithm < in > out'
