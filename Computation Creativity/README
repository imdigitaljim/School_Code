To run this script, it looks for corpus.txt in the current working directory.  

This twitterbot uses Python 3.5 with libraries:

-Tweepy for Twitter posting
-BeautifulSoup for parsing various metadata from the corpus
-Markovify to apply Markov Chains to the corpus and generate sentences. 

This twitterbot is designed to take in a corpus and develop 
creative sentences using Markov Chains. The corpus I 
developed and trained the bot consists of all of J.R.R. 
Tolkien Lord of the Rings books and an equal part of JK 
Rowling's Harry Potter series. I wanted to see the 
twitterbot post comments, phrases, or storyline information 
that mixes both universes. The markov chain chooses a 
starting word and runs through the chain until it gets to an 
end within 140 characters. It will continue to run until a valid sentence is generated.

I have used Amazon Web Services for virtualization. The twitterbot is set up on Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) instance and will run the script every hour.
