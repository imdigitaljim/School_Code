Buffer Overflow


To build the vulnerable program and the exploit program, *sudo privileges required:

$make

This will also result in setting the virtual address space randomization to 0 with:

$echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

The vulnerable program with source called "stack.c" is made using the flags -fno-stack-protector -z execstack which disable stack protection and makes the stack executable should it have code that can run. The vulnerability in this program is with the way strcpy is used. The vulnerable function "int bof(char *str)" has a 24byte buffer that is used as the destination of strcpy and a source buffer passed in as a parameter. In this case strcpy will read from the source until it encounters a null terminator from the expected cstring. This buffer is read in from a file called "badfile" of size 517bytes. 

In the exploit program made with "exploit.c", I performed a few tests first using an easily identifiable pattern of length 250. This far exceeds the buffer meant for the cstring and with this pattern it will segmentation fault because this will overwrite the $eip register so that the address of the next instruction will be an invalid. Then when examining the stack I can identify an offset location where the stack $eip memory location should be.  Using gdb on the vuln program I can see what made it into the $eip where the instruction failed and caused the segmentation fault using "i r $eip." I can determine the offset using this information. The offset ends up being 36 bytes which can be determined with the 2 parameters that got pushed on the stack (8 bytes), the length of the buffer itself (24 bytes), and then the frame pointer of the function (4 bytes). The following 4 bytes (after the previous 36) are the $eip. That means that for the payload, we want the $eip to be hijacked so that we go to the next instruction being an address of the sled section or at least the beginning of the shellcode. The sled section contains nops, aka just blank instructions, and then sequentially will get to the shellcode. This allows for a large amount of memory address flexibility to set our shellcode somewhere in the sled and determining the address to hijack in the $eip. We can also investigate the stack for the memory location of our shellcode and sled in gdb using x\200xb.
Then putting it all together, I add the sled/shellcode $eip hijack address to the stream at the correct location.

#define EIP "\x80\xf5\xff\xbf" //$eip written as a directive literal in little endian format

sprintf(&buffer[36], "%s", EIP);
sprintf(&buffer[400], "%s", shellcode);

Running the following commands will create the badfile and execute the exploit

$make 
$exploit
$vuln

The result will be shell accessibility.
