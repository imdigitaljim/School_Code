Analysing the worst-case time complexity of the member function pop() of Queue. Give the complexity in the form of Big-O. Your analysis can be informal; however, it must be clearly understandable by others. Name the file containing the complexity analysis as "analysis.txt".

template <typename T>
void Queue<T>::pop()
{
	container.pop_front();
}

Since my container is a list the complexity of the pop() listed above is O(1)
because it simply just removes the element directly, there is no iteration.
