This project can be done utilizing the command line or a GUI (the GUI option will get an additional 20pts).

For this project, I do encourage information sharing.  By this, if someone asks a questions, you can help them in any way so long as you don't type any code.  In other words:

1.  You need to write a while loop followed by if/else statements. - OK
2.  You need to write 1 while loop followed by 3 if/else statements. - Borderline, try to avoid.
3.  You need to write while(x>1){}. - DON'T - Penalties will be assessed for code sharing.

Also, if you find code on the web or in a book, use it.... BUT You will need to provide your source DO NOT SHARE YOUR RESOURCE WITH ANYONE!

Acceptance Criteria:
1.  FSU title bar.
2.  The footer should include your name.
3.  All logic must be written in Java.
4.  Minimum requirement is the ability for 2 human players.
5.  You can be creative.  The game does not have to be exactly like the wireframes, but it does have to be obvious that the game is Tic Tac Toe.
6.  Extra credit will be given for going above and beyond.  For example:
a.  Playing against the computer.
b.  Adding AI to the computer's responses such as building in logic so that if player X has two in a row, then Player O will detect that and block.
c.  Instead of X's and O's, give the ability to use college mascots.  X may be an image of a Seminole where O may be an image of a Gator.
7.  Absolutely NO AUTO GENERATED CODE!  Any detection of this will result in a zero.
